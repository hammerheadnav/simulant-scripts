# simulant-scripts

This repo has a set of SimulANT+ scripts to be used with sensor testing.  The scripts are located under `./Scripts` which is the location under SimulANT+ on a PC where the scripts are to be dropped in order to make them appear under the script drop-down for a particular sensor type in SimulANT+.

Because of the way SimulANT+ locates scripts for playback, scripts need to be placed in the subdirectory for each sensor type.  For some sensors (like the various power meter types), this means that the scripts need to be copied or otherwise referenced in multiple directpories to conveniently use them from all sensor types.
