# simulant-scripts

This repo has a set of SimulANT+ scripts to be used with sensor testing.  The scripts are located under `./Scripts` which is the location under SimulANT+ on a PC where the scripts are to be dropped in order to make them appear under the script drop-down for a particular sensor type in SimulANT+.
